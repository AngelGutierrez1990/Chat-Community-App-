# Chat-Community-App

Hey world üåç

I'm working on a pet-project of building a chat/community app.

## Why?

Inspired by my awesome colleagues at [status.im](https://status.im/), the web3 community in general, the constant abuse & leaks of personal data and the perversion of privacy in our digital lives which seems to be ever increasing under the pretense of safety & fighting terrorism ... So with all that I thought 'Why not create one myself, might be fun ...'.

## What?

I'm looking to build a chat/community app with three core areas which I think is the reason include:

* Privacy
* Intuitive
* Fun

I'll be visualising this like my favourite game BOTW's inventory slots.

_So I'll have these core areas and as my XP increase so too can the number of slots in each one increase._

### This will be an ever growing list but those areas include attributes such as:

* Privacy
  * Encrypted
  * P2P
  * Anonymity

* Intuitive 
  * Simple
  * Smooth
  * Elegant

* Fun
  * It's just fun dawg

## How?

- Learn to code (Critical Mission #1)
- Make small applications (Chat & Community)
- Get help / contributions from others

_... With that it'll be a long journey & these plans are sure to evolve and change, but let's get started._
