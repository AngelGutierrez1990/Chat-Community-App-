/* Review
Letâ€™s take one more glance at the concepts we just learned:

Data is printed, or logged, to the console, a panel that displays messages, with console.log().
We can write single-line comments with // and multi-line comments between /* and */.
/* There are 7 fundamental data types in JavaScript: strings, numbers, booleans, null, undefined, symbol, and object.
Numbers are any number without quotes: 23.8879
Strings are characters wrapped in single or double quotes: 'Sample String'
The built-in arithmetic operators include +, -, *, /, and %.
Objects, including instances of data types, can have properties, stored information. The properties are denoted with a . after the name of the object, for example: 'Hello'.length.
Objects, including instances of data types, can have methods which perform actions. Methods are called by appending the object or instance with a period, the method name, and parentheses. For example: 'hello'.toUpperCase().
We can access properties and methods by using the ., dot operator.
Built-in objects, including Math, are collections of methods and properties that JavaScript provides. */ 

// Using variables (var)
var favouriteFood = 'pizza';

var numOfSlices = 8;

console.log(favouriteFood); // it would show pizza
console.log(numOfSlices); // it would show 8

// Changable variable (let)
let changeMe = true
changeMe = false

console.log(changeMe); // it would show as false

// Constant variable (cont)
const entree = 'Enchiladas';
console.log(entree); // this would show Enchiladas
entree = 'Tacos' // This would bring up an error message as it's false

// Maths with let
let x = 20;
x -= 5; // Can be written as x = x - 5
console.log(x); // Output: 15
 
let y = 50;
y *= 2; // Can be written as y = y * 2
console.log(y); // Output: 100
 
let z = 8;
z /= 2; // Can be written as z = z / 2
console.log(z); // Output: 4

// I edited some of the equations below by reassigning the value with a +=, -=, *= and /=
let levelUp = 10;
levelUp += 5;
let powerLevel = 9001;
powerLevel -=100
let multiplyMe = 32;
multiplyMe *= 11;
let quarterMe = 1152;
quarterMe /= 4;

// String Concatenation with Variables
let myPet = 'armadillo';
console.log('I own a pet ' + myPet + '.'); // Output: 'I own a pet armadillo.'


// if, else if, and else statements

// Simple if statement

let sale = true;
sale = false // Once this statement is added the code will not execute as it's now false 
 if (sale) {
   console.log('Time to buy!');
   // Code to execute if the provided condition evaluates to true
 }
 
 // Else statement Example below

if (false) {
  console.log('The code in this block will not run.');
} else {
  console.log('But the code in this block will!');
}
// Prints: But the code in this block will!

// Simple else statement

let sale = true;

  console.log('Time to buy!');
} else {
  console.log('Time to wait for a sale.')
}


// Comparison Operators
/*
Less than: <
Greater than: >
Less than or equal to: <=
Greater than or equal to: >=
Is equal to: ===
Is not equal to: !==
*/ 

let hungerLevel = 8; // Set hunger level

// Logical Operators
/* the and operator (&&)
the or operator (||)
the not operator, otherwise known as the bang operator (!)
*/

// Example of a stoplight

if (stopLight === 'green' && pedestrians === 0) {

// Example of weekend

let mood = 'sleepy'; // setting mood
let tirednessLevel = 7; // setting tiredness

// CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS ternary operators 

// Example 
let isNightTime = true;

// Ternary operator example
isNightTime ? console.log('Turn on the lights!') : console.log('Turn off the lights!'); // Why is is not done this way, seems much faster at first glance?

// Another example, ok this shit is so much simpler & clearer to read

let isLocked = false;

// else if statements, used for various outcomes, this example shows traffic lights.
